# Sentiment Analysis on Comments from Danish Political Articles on Social Media
This repository contains annotated data meant to be used with supervised machine learning algorithms. The dataset was created specifically to classify sentences to the root comments of Danish political articles on social media.

The dataset consists of 9008 sentences that are labelled with fine-grained polarity in the range from -2 to 2 (negative to postive). The quality of the fine-grained is not cross validated and is therefore subject to uncertainties; however, the simple polarity has been cross validated and therefore is considered to be more correct. <br/>
